%% Parity tests between the HTTP validation backend and the real
%% rabbit_auth_backend_http it validates.
%%
%% The validation backend does not reimplement an upstream parser (unlike the
%% LDAP query DSL), so there is no single equal-both-implementations check like
%% aws_auth_validate_tests:parity_test_/0. What it DOES do is build request
%% queries and interpret allow/deny responses the same way the real backend
%% does, mirroring that contract by hand. These tests pin the parts of that
%% contract that upstream exposes, so a change in rabbit_auth_backend_http that
%% would make the probe diverge from a real broker request is caught here rather
%% than silently.
%%
%% What is checked:
%%   * query encoding parity -- the probe's per-path query strings encode
%%     identically to rabbit_auth_backend_http:q/1 (the exported query builder
%%     the broker uses). This is a true differential test: both are run on the
%%     same params and asserted equal.
%%   * tag-join parity -- join_tags/1 is referenced by the authz query shape.
%%   * response-grammar contract -- our classify_response/2 accepts exactly the
%%     allow/deny forms the broker's own parsing accepts, and rejects the rest.
%%     The broker's parsing is inline in user_login_authentication/2 and req/2
%%     (not an exported pure function), so this side is asserted against the
%%     documented grammar rather than by calling upstream directly.
%%
%% Like the LDAP parity tests, the differential checks run only when upstream is
%% actually usable in this node (the module and its deps loaded); otherwise they
%% skip rather than fail spuriously across the RMQ-version CI matrix.

%% For every probe path type, the query string our backend sends must encode
%% byte-for-byte the same as rabbit_auth_backend_http:q/1 given the same params.
%% If upstream ever changes its encoding (e.g. space as %20 instead of +, or a
%% different escaping of `/'), the probe would send params a conformant auth
%% server parses differently and this fails.

%% Spot-check the encoding of individual special characters, independent of the
%% fixed probe params, so a regression is attributable to encoding rather than to
%% a params change. uri_string:compose_query/1 is the encoder query_for/1
%% delegates to, so this compares the two encoders directly.
%%
%% Two groups, because the encoders agree byte-for-byte on most characters but
%% not all:
%%   * AGREE -- space (both `+'), `/', `#', and reserved `&'/`=' encode
%%     identically, so byte equality holds and pins that no regression appears.
%%   * DIVERGE-BUT-SAFE -- `~' (upstream leaves literal, compose_query emits
%%     %7E) and `*' (upstream emits %2A, compose_query leaves literal) differ in
%%     bytes but decode to the same character, so a conformant auth server that
%%     percent-decodes reads the same param either way. Asserting byte equality
%%     here would be wrong; assert post-decode (semantic) equivalence instead,
%%     which is the property that actually matters on the wire.
