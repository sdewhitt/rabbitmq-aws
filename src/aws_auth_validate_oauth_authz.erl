%% Optional OAuth authorization-evaluation layer, wired as an opt-in step in
%% aws_auth_validate_oauth (activates only when a request carries an authz_check
%% block; a no-op otherwise).
%%
%% Purpose: given a *already-verified* customer-supplied access token (signature
%% + exp + aud already checked by aws_auth_validate_oauth), answer "would the
%% broker grant this principal <permission> on <vhost>/<resource>?" -- i.e. reach
%% an authorization decision, not just an authentication one. This is a
%% troubleshooting/triage aid: it localizes WHICH layer of an OAuth config is
%% wrong (reachability vs. authentication vs. authorization) and, for authz,
%% names the failing STAGE (see the reason macros), deflecting the "my token is
%% broken (it isn't)" support ticket without a broker restart.
%%
%% Design: RUNTIME SOFT DEPENDENCY on rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2.
%%   * We do NOT add it to the plugin's DEPS (it is not force-loaded onto
%%     aws-plugin users who never run OAuth).
%%   * We CALL its exported, pure decision functions when-and-only-when the
%%     module is already loaded on the broker, guarded by
%%     erlang:function_exported/3. When it is not loaded, authz evaluation is
%%     unavailable and we say so with a fixed category -- we never fall back to a
%%     home-grown scope matcher (that would reintroduce the drift risk this
%%     approach exists to avoid).
%%   * Because we EXECUTE the broker's own SCOPE-MATCHING code rather than mirror
%%     it, the matching logic itself cannot drift. The parity guarantee is scoped
%%     to that: it covers the fields we overlay onto the #resource_server{} record
%%     below -- scope_prefix, scope_aliases, additional_scopes_key -- plus the
%%     scope_pattern_syntax we thread through. It does NOT cover
%%     resource-server config the broker also consumes but that this endpoint does
%%     not model: resource_server_type (the rich-authorization-request path in
%%     normalize_token_scope), extra_scopes_source, preferred_username_claims, and
%%     per-`resource_servers' map entries. Those stay at new_resource_server/1
%%     defaults here. For an operator relying on them, this endpoint can under-
%%     report effective scopes and thus FAIL an authz_check the live broker would
%%     grant (the safe direction -- it never over-grants -- but still a parity gap
%%     to document, not a "drift is impossible" claim). Extending the overlay to
%%     those fields is a documented follow-up.
%%
%% The broker functions used (all verified pure -- no app-env / ETS / mnesia on
%% this path; they read all config from the #resource_server{} record we build):
%%   * rabbit_oauth2_resource_server:new_resource_server/1  -- record constructor
%%   * rabbit_auth_backend_oauth2:normalize_token_scope/2   -- alias / additional-
%%       scopes-key / prefix-filter expansion (the IAM `scope_aliases' path)
%%   * rabbit_auth_backend_oauth2:get_expanded_scopes/3     -- {vhost} placeholder
%%       expansion
%%   * rabbit_oauth2_scope:{vhost,resource,topic}_access/*  -- the final match
%%
%% R3 (zero side effects): every function above is side-effect-free; the config
%% comes from the record argument, so this reads nothing from broker state and
%% mutates nothing. We construct the #resource_server{} from CUSTOMER-SUPPLIED
%% fields, so we are validating the customer's config, not the broker's live one.
%% (Verified: no ETS / mnesia / persistent_term / application:get_env on this
%% call path -- the only side effect reachable is rabbit_oauth2_scope's own
%% ?LOG_WARNING on a rejected/invalid pattern, which carries no token or claim
%% content. The impure resource-server *resolution* functions that DO read
%% app-env are bypassed by constructing the record via new_resource_server/1.)
%%
%% scope_pattern_syntax: both `wildcard' (the default, used by IAM and the
%% documented OAuth recipe) and `regex' are accepted. The regex path carries NO
%% new ReDoS surface: rabbit_oauth2_scope runs the SAME bounded matcher the live
%% broker runs on every OAuth-authenticated connection -- a 2048-byte pattern
%% cap, a rejected-construct denylist (inline modifiers / callouts / comments /
%% control verbs), and hard PCRE bounds (match_limit=10000,
%% match_limit_recursion=1000) that cap backtracking regardless of pattern. A
%% crafted pattern cannot exceed what the broker already permits at auth time,
%% and the concurrency semaphore bounds how many run at once. Allowing regex
%% keeps validation parity with a broker configured for regex scopes.

-define(AVAIL_CACHE_KEY, {?MODULE, available}).

%% The evaluation path builds the broker's #resource_server{} record, so it needs
%% that record's shape (from oauth2.hrl). But rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2 is a
%% RUNTIME soft dependency, not a build DEPS: the plugin is compiled against a
%% range of broker series, and the oauth2 backend's shape is NOT stable across
%% them -- older series (e.g. 3.13.x) ship no oauth2.hrl at all, and newer ones
%% add record fields (scope_pattern_syntax). Hard-including the header would make
%% the whole plugin fail to COMPILE on any series that lacks it, defeating the
%% soft-dependency design (the feature is meant to be merely UNAVAILABLE there,
%% via available/0, not a build break).
%%
%% So the header include and the record-using evaluation code are guarded by
%% -ifdef(HAVE_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_SERVER), a macro the Makefile defines only when
%% $(DEPS_DIR)/rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2/include/oauth2.hrl actually exists at
%% build time. When it is absent, the module still compiles; available/0 returns
%% false and maybe_check/2 reports config_conflict (authz unavailable). When it
%% is present, the record-typed evaluator is compiled in. We do NOT reference
%% fields that vary across supported series (scope_pattern_syntax): the syntax is
%% threaded as a plain argument to the scope functions instead (see evaluate/3).

%% Fixed reasons. NOTE on granularity vs R4: R4's fixed-category rule guards
%% against leaking BROKER INFRASTRUCTURE or an SSRF target (hostnames, IPs, raw

%% failure reasons below are categorically different: they describe only the
%% CALLER'S OWN token and the CALLER'S OWN supplied authorization config (both
%% arrived in this same request), never broker infra or a network target -- the
%% same basis on which token_expired/token_invalid were already split out. So we
%% keep a single error CATEGORY (authz_unverified) for the audit-log/response
%% contract but differentiate the human-readable message, which is what actually
%% lets a customer self-diagnose the "my token is broken (it isn't)" case. The
%% messages carry NO scope values or claim content -- they name the failing
%% STAGE, not the data -- so no token material is echoed, and (per the design
%% decision) the message is not audit-logged regardless.

%% True when the broker has the oauth2 decision functions available on the code
%% path. Used both to gate the request and (in aws_auth_validate_oauth) to decide
%% whether to offer authz mode at all.
%%
%% available/0 is the strong property: the oauth2 backend is loaded AND exposes
%% the exact arity-4 scope API this layer calls. backend_loaded/0 is the weaker
%% property: rabbit_auth_backend_oauth2 is loaded at all, regardless of its API
%% version. The two differ precisely on the portability regression Luke flagged:
%% a broker series that ships the oauth2 backend but predates resource_access/4.
%% Tests use the pair to tell a legitimate skip (backend absent entirely) from a
%% hard failure (backend present but API too old -- must not pass silently).
%%
%% We use code:ensure_loaded/1 rather than a bare erlang:function_exported/3:
%% the latter returns false for a module whose beam is on the path but has not
%% yet been loaded into the VM, which would make availability depend on load
%% order (a request could see the oauth2 backend as "absent" simply because
%% nothing had called it yet this boot). ensure_loaded triggers the load if the
%% beam is present, so this reflects "is the backend installed" -- the property
%% we actually want -- and stays false only when the backend genuinely is not
%% deployed on this broker.
%%
%% Memoization: a positive result is cached in persistent_term so the per-request
%% probe (3x code:ensure_loaded + 4x function_exported) runs at most once per
%% boot. We cache ONLY `true' -- never `false' -- so a backend that loads AFTER
%% the first call (e.g. plugin enabled at runtime) is still picked up on a later
%% request rather than being pinned "unavailable" for the node's lifetime.
