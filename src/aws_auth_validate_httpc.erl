%% Shared ephemeral-httpc-profile pool for the http and oauth validation
%% backends. (The ldap backend uses eldap, not httpc, so it does not use this.)
%%
%% This machinery exists ONLY because httpc pools TLS sessions on a global,
%% named-profile basis: the shared default profile would let a prior request's
%% authenticated (e.g. mTLS) session be reused by a later request -- a false
%% success and a cross-request connection leak (R3 violation). Each in-flight
%% probe therefore OWNS a distinct started profile drawn from a FIXED pool of
%% ?PROFILE_POOL_SIZE interned atoms (a fresh atom per request would leak the
%% atom table). A slot is claimed only by successfully starting it, so two
%% simultaneous calls never share a profile and none is ever stolen from an
%% actively-probing peer. The pool is sized strictly above the concurrency cap
%% (auth_validation_max_concurrent = 100) so the scan always finds a free slot.
%%
%% Both backends carried a byte-identical copy of this before; the only
%% difference was the profile-name prefix (kept per-backend so the two pools
%% never collide), which is now a parameter.

%% advance to the next slot -- never stop a slot in use by a peer, that would
